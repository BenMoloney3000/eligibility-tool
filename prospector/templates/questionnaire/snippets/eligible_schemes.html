{% if eco4_eligibility or eco4flex_eligibility %}
    <h4>ECO4</h4>
    <p>
        ECO4 is funded by the government and the major energy suppliers in Great Britain.
        The government requires the energy suppliers to contribute to the Energy Company
        Obligation (ECO) scheme, which aims to improve the energy efficiency and heating
        of low-income and fuel-poor households.
    </p>

    {% if eco4_condition_1 %}
        <p>
            We think this fund might help you with the upgrades your home would benefit
            from. Contact us for more information.
        </p>
    {% elif eco4_condition_2 %}
        <p>
            It looks like you could be eligible for this scheme. However, we think it is
            likely that the grant would not cover the full cost of the necessary works.
            You may find it difficult to get help with this scheme. Contact your energy
            supplier for more guidance.

{% if bus_eligibility %}
    <h4>BUS</h4>
    <p>
        The Boiler Upgrade Scheme or "BUS", is a government initiative that offers grants to help
        property owners replace their fossil fuel heating systems with heat pumps or biomass boilers.
        The scheme aims to reduce carbon emissions, energy bills, and fuel poverty. The scheme is
        funded by the government and the major energy suppliers, and administered by Ofgem.
    </p>
    <p>
        We think this fund might help you with the upgrades your home needs. You should

            contact some local MCS accredited heat pump installers</a>. We recommend getting three quotes.
    </p>
    {% if not_in_mains_gas %}
        <p>
            You are likely to be required to contribute toward the cost of a heat pump but replacing
            your current system with an air source heat pump is likely to significantly reduce your
            bills and carbon emissions.
        </p>
    {% else %}
        <p>
            The cost of installing a heat pump usually exceeds the value of the grant and may
            cost you more than replacing a gas boiler. The bills are likely to remain similar,
            but it would result in a significant reduction in carbon emissions.
        </p>

{% if gbis_eligibility %}
    <p>
        The Great British Insulation Scheme or "GBIS", is a government initiative that offers
        free or subsidised insulation to reduce the energy bills of low-income and fuel-poor
        households in Great Britain. The scheme targets homes with low energy efficiency ratings
        and certain council tax bands. The scheme is funded by the government and the major
        energy suppliers and administered by Ofgem.
    </p>
    <p>
        The grant funding is only likely to cover some of the cost of any work. Contact your
        energy supplier for more guidance.
