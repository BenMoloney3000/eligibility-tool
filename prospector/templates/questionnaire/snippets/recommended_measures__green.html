<p>The even better news is that you could be eligible for some funding!</p>
<p>
    Funding is targeted towards households with low incomes that are
    living in less energy efficient homes.
    {% if sap_rating %}
    {# Green1 result #}
    Both your household income and your housing efficiency would make
    you eligible for funding.
    {% else %}
    {# Green2 result #}
    We think that both your household income and your housing
    efficiency would make you eligible for funding. However it looks
    like your house has never had an energy assessment, so we think you
    are eligible based on our best estimate but this may prove
    incorrect when a survey is done.

<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>
    Being eligible for funding doesn’t always mean it is easy to find
    an installer who will do the work. This is where we come in.
</p>
<p>
    We really want to help make your home warmer, save you some money and
    cut carbon emissions. So, if you leave your details, we will let you
    know when there is a scheme that could help you.
</p>
<p>
    This might be through a scheme we deliver but we will continue to
    investigate other offers available in the city and keep in touch with
    you. We can also bring you together with other households to get
    collective quotes that drive a better deal from installers.
</p>
<p>
    If you could answer some further questions, it would help us to
    match you with a scheme sooner. We know you’re a busy person
    though, so if you don’t have more time we can work with what you
    have already provided.
