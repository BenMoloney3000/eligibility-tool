            Funding is targeted towards households with low incomes that are
            living in less energy efficient homes. While it looks like you
            would be eligible for schemes based on the energy efficiency of
            your home, however your income would be too high.

            We understand this can be disappointing and there are plenty of
            people outside the income thresholds that need support.

            Funding is targeted towards households with low incomes that are
            living in less energy efficient homes.
            It looks like both your income and home energy efficiency would be too high
            to qualify.

        Funding is targeted towards households with low incomes that are
        living in less energy efficient homes. While it looks like you
        would be eligible for schemes based on your income, your property
        would be deemed too energy efficient.

    <p>
        We understand this can be disappointing and it does not mean your
        property couldn’t be improved, just that it hasn’t been prioritised
        for funding yet.
