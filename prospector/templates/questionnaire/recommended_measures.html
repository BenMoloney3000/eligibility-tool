            Thank you for taking the time to answer our questions.

            Funding is targeted towards households with low incomes that are
            living in less energy efficient homes. While it looks like you
            would be eligible for schemes based on the energy efficiency of
            your home, however your income would be too high.

            We understand this can be disappointing and there are plenty of

            Your property would meet the eligibility criteria for all schemes,
            but your income would be too high for some.
            This means it may take longer and be harder work to find a scheme

            schemes, but your house would be too energy efficient for some.

            for some schemes.

            Your house has never had an energy assessment, so we think you are

            when a survey is done. However your income would be too high for
            some schemes.

        <h2>What next?</h2>
        <p>
            Being eligible for funding doesn’t always mean it is easy to find
            an installer who will do the work. This is where we come in.
        </p>
        <p>
            We really want to help make your home warmer, save you some money and
            cut carbon emissions. So, if you leave your details, we will let you
            know when there is a scheme that could help you.
        </p>
        <p>
            This might be through a scheme we deliver but we will continue to
            investigate other offers available in the city and keep in touch with
            you. We can also bring you together with other households to get
            collective quotes that drive a better deal from installers.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you could answer some further questions, it would help us to
            match you with a scheme sooner. We know you’re a busy person
            though, so if you don’t have more time we can work with what you
            have already provided.
