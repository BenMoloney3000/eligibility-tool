            <strong>You are unlikely to be eligible for funding for these measures</strong>.
            Please <a href="https://plymouthenergycommunity.com/contact-us">get in contact</a>

            We would like to ask you a few more questions about your preferences and house
            so that we can build better schemes in the future. If you would rather not do
            this you can stop here.

            <strong>You may be eligible for some funding</strong> however both your property's
            energy performance and your household income are higher than the thresholds
            for some funding. We will need to ask some more questions to be sure.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would rather not do this you can stop here, and a PEC staff member
            can take these details from you over the phone at some point. Note
            that this will delay any application for funding that we can submit for you.

        <p>
            <strong>It looks like you are eligible for funding</strong> based on the information
            you've supplied.  We now need to ask some further questions to clarify the best
            source of funding for you.
